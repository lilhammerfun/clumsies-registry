# 英文写作规范

识别并消除 AI 写作痕迹，让文字更自然、更有人味。

## 核心原则

避免 AI 模式只是一半工作。无菌、无声的文字同样明显。好的写作背后有真人。

## 灵魂注入

### 无灵魂写作的特征

- 每句话长度和结构相同
- 只有中立报道，没有观点
- 不承认不确定性或复杂感受
- 该用第一人称时不用
- 没有幽默、没有锋芒、没有个性
- 读起来像维基百科或新闻稿

### 如何注入灵魂

**Have opinions.** 不只报道事实，要对事实有反应。"I genuinely don't know how to feel about this" 比中立列举利弊更像人。

**Vary your rhythm.** Short punchy sentences. Then longer ones that take their time getting where they're going.

**Acknowledge complexity.** 真人有复杂感受。"This is impressive but also kind of unsettling" 比 "This is impressive" 好。

**Use "I" when it fits.** 第一人称不是不专业，是诚实。"I keep coming back to..." 或 "Here's what gets me..." 表明有真人在思考。

**Let some mess in.** 完美结构感觉像算法。离题、旁白、半成型想法是人类特征。

**Be specific about feelings.** 不是 "this is concerning"，而是 "there's something unsettling about agents churning away at 3am while nobody's watching."

## 完整示例

### Before

> Great question! Here is an essay on this topic. I hope this helps!
>
> AI-assisted coding serves as an enduring testament to the transformative potential of large language models, marking a pivotal moment in the evolution of software development. In today's rapidly evolving technological landscape, these groundbreaking tools—nestled at the intersection of research and practice—are reshaping how engineers ideate, iterate, and deliver, underscoring their vital role in modern workflows.

### After

> AI coding assistants speed up some tasks. In a 2024 study by Google, developers using Codex completed simple functions 55% faster than a control group, but showed no improvement on debugging or architectural decisions.
>
> The tools are good at boilerplate: config files, test scaffolding, repetitive refactors. They are bad at knowing when they are wrong. I have mass-accepted suggestions that compiled, passed lint, and still did the wrong thing because I stopped paying attention.
