- Update indexer to record reserve_usdc and reserve_tokens
- Update query services to calculate price from reserves on-the-fly
- Optimize Docker build with cargo-chef
- Sync contract ABIs
```

**Small change (no reason needed)**:
```
chore: update contract addresses

- Update implementation addresses
- Sync ABIs with deployed contracts
```
